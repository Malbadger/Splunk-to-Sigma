# Splunk-to-Sigma
Python parser that converts Splunk detections to Sigma Rules.

----

Work to be completed:
Need to add functionality for the parser to take out Keywords, the ability for it to handle detections containing subsearches, and the ability to correctly parse lookups.


Need to test against highly complicated and very long splunk searches.
